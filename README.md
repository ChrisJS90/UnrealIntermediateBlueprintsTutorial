# IntermediateBps

Developed with Unreal Engine 5

For this tutorial I added in a functioning stamina system that decreases stamina when sprinting and recovers when not. I also added in a damage and death system. When the player dies they respawn at the last checkpoint they ran over. Note this does not reload the entire level, it disables player inputs and starts a game over screen. Once the game over screen is complete the player is reset to the checkpoint location and player input is enabled again.
